# WPFWindowManager

This project is just a simple "window manager" concept made in C# using WPF.
It targets .NET Framework 4.5.2 and was made using Visual Studio 2013.
Tested only on Win7 x64, but compiled for any processor arch. 
It makes use of WinAPI and is related to my other project, WPF3DWindowViewer (it uses parts of this project as basis).
